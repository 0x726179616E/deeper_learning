# deeper_learning

This repo contains some machine learning / deep learning programs I've implemented for autodidactic purposes.

#### Sections (*TBD):

0. linear models (regression, classification)
1. autograd engine (very rudimentary via numpy)
2. multilayer perceptron
3. convolutional neural networks
4. *residual networks
5. *recurrent neural networks
6. *long short-term memory
7. *gated recurrent units
8. *transformers
9. *large language models
