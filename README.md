# deeper_learning

Some machine learning programs I've implemented for autodidactic purposes.

#### Sections (*WIP):

0. linear models (regression, classification)
1. autograd engine (very rudimentary via numpy)
2. multilayer perceptrons
3. convolutional neural networks
4. *recurrent neural networks (LSTM)
5. *transformers
