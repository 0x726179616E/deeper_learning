# deeper_learning

This repo contains my implementations of some machine learning / deep learning algorithms for autodidactic purposes.

A goal here is to use as few dependencies as practically possible in order to understand how these models work before I begin to abstract them away using heavier frameworks.

Sections (WIP):

0. linear models (regression, classification)
1. autograd engine (very rudimentary via numpy)
2. multilayer perceptron
